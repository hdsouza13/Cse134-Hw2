            <h3>Nasa California Space Grant Consortium</h3>
            <p><em>The Lunar Lava Tube Exploration</em> challenges teams to explore a lunar lava tube with an eye toward its potential for human
                habitation. The overall challenge is building a rover and developing programs that allow the rover to navigate the
                challenge course, a model lunar lava tube using an arduino</p>

            <p>
                <dfn>The Regency Young Scholar Science Program</dfn> aims to bridge the gap 
                in science education for children who may not have access to hands-on learning 
                experiences. Through engaging experiments and activities, the program introduces
                 fundamental scientific principles in an accessible and fun way. 
                 By fostering curiosity and exploration, 
                 it not only enhances scientific knowledge but also nurtures critical 
                 thinking and problem-solving skills from an early age. 
                 The program strives to inspire a lifelong passion for science, 
                 encouraging children to see the world through an analytical lens 
                 and empowering them to become future innovators and leaders in 
                 their communities.
